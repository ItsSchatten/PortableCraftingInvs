# This file allows you to edit MOST messages in the plugin, there are some messages you
# cannot edit as they are hard coded into the plugin, if you really want those messages
# to be editable (and if there is enough support for it) I will try and add it.
# Please note that if there is ever an update to this file, like new messages were added,
# we take the liberty to automatically add the value into this file.
# So it is recommended before updating to the newest version to back up your 'settings.yml'
# and 'messages.yml' files to save your work.
#
# If you have questions,
# you may post an issue on GitHub (https://github.com/itsschatten/portablecraftinginvs/issues).
# GitHub is also helpful if you want to see the code for the plugin.
