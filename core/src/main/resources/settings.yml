# It should be noted, if you've disabled all virtual tiles or disabled the virtual tile API,
# this configuration is not taken into account, and the plugin will not attempt to connect to a database
# or store data.
#
# Valid options:
#   Easy to Read:
#   (Does not require any additional configuration.)
#   - YAML -> Stores furnace and brewing stand directly into a per-player config file.
#             Similar to EssentialX's approach.
#
#   Remote databases:
#   (These require additional configuration below.)
#   - MySQL
#   - MariaDB
#
# YAML is the default option.
method: YAML

# All of these configuration options are similar to LuckPerms.
database:
  # The address to connect to your SQL database.
  # You should add the port if it differs from 3306.
