# This file allows you to edit MOST messages in the plugin, there are some messages you
# cannot edit as they are hard coded into the plugin, if you really want those messages
# to be editable (and if there is enough support for it) I will try and add it.
# Please note that if there is ever an update to this file, like new message were added
# we take the liberty to automatically add the value into this file BUT due to the way
# Bukkit/Spigot save configuration files all of my 'helpful' comments are removed. So it
# is recommended before updating to the newest version to backup your config and messages
# file to save your work and to keep the comments.
#
# If you have questions you can post an issue on BitBucket
# (https://bitbucket.org/itsschatten/portablecraftinginvs/issues) Also helpful if you want to
# see the code for the plugin.
# You can also message me on Discord (Schatten#4113)
